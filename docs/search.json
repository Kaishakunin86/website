    "text": "Vowel Perception\nMy dissertation research will focus on investigating how the fundamental frequency (f0) and higher formants (f3-f5) affect the perception of vowel quality in English. Some questions that I hope to answer are related to how perceptual categorization boundaries shift according with manipulations in f0 and the higher formants. Through my work I hope to address the nature of the effect of f0 and the higher formants and their magnitudes in relation to the uniform scaling hypothesis and the Probabilistic Sliding Template Model of Vowel Perception (PSTM).\nIn my qualifying exam paper, I looked at how listeners use the socio-indexical information of gender to inform the weighting of vowel duration and its effect on the perception of voicing for coda stops in English."
