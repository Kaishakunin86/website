My graduate research focuses on questions related to how listeners use socio-indexical information for the weighting of varying phonetic cues in the process of speech perception. I have recently completed a speech perception experiment at UC Davis that will serve as basis of my qualifying paper for PhD candidacy in Linguistics.
